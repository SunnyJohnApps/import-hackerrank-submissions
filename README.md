# Import Hackerrank Submissions

### The javascript file will create separate code files from HackerRank Submissions data file. The code files will be grouped in folders based on programming languages.


1. First go to hackerrank.com -> Settings -> Export Data.
2. Click on Create new Archive and then Download Archive to download all your HackerRank Data.
3. Extract the .json file from the downloaded archive and copy it to a project folder.
4. Use the index.js file in this repository to create separate code files for all your submissions.
5. Remember to change the input json file name in index.js
6. Also modify the lang variable to support your programming languages and include their extensions.

By default, I included only code that have passed all tests i.e. a score of 1.
